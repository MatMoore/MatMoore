## My projects
Here are a few examples of my work online. For more projects, see my website at https://matmoore.github.io/

### (2020) List of online board games and party games

- Blog post: [A list of board games and party games you can play online](https://dev.to/matmooredev/a-list-of-board-games-and-party-games-you-can-play-online-4741)

I created this site at the start of the pandemic to track websites where you can play tabletop games remotely and since then have gathered many online games, platforms and print & play games. I used github pages to make it as easy as possible to contribute to. 

### (2020) COVID API (no longer active)
- Source code: [andreagrandi/covid-api](https://github.com/andreagrandi/covid-api)

In early 2020 I collaborated with [@andreagrandi](https://github.com/andreagrandi) to wrangle public data about COVID rates into an API, using python and fastapi.

This project was a great reminder of how important data collection and curation is when using data in the real world.

During this early phase of the pandemic, countries were scrambling to report any data at all, and there was a lot of typos and unreliable classification creeping in due to manual processing of the data. Even Johns Hopkins CSSE, the source of many figures reported in the news at the time, was publishing data with a lot of errors in it, and when we were working on this API they were often changing the schema to accomodate more and more granualar information (e.g. moving from country-level to county-level and starting to code the source of the statistics instead of relying on free text).

As the pandemic continued, the ways of detecting COVID changed, and countries changed what was reported, and who gets counted in the statistics, so our code is now out of date.
